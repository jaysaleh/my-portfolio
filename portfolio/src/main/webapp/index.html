                <p>This was my family's first computer, the eMachine T3985. I loved this thing. I remember spending long nights playing computer games. Around this time I also started school at first grade. I missed preschool, kindgarden, and part of first grade as I was out of the country.</p>

                <p>This is where I went to Elementary School. I spent 2006 - 2011 here. As mentioned previously, I started education at 1st grade so the majority of my time here was spent catching up. I'll take the next few slides to introduce my town/schools. Shoutout to Mr. McKilligan, you're a real one.</p>

                <p>This is my high school. I would say about 90% of my lifetime memories come from this place. I made alot of freinds here through several activities such as cross country, track and field, rocketry club, the 3D printing lab, and science olympiad. As much as I hated this place while I was there, I miss the memories I made with my friends before we all went our respective paths.</p>

                <p>I started school on Septemeber 21st 2018. Going into college I was premed. After taking CS106B, I found the content very enagaging and decided to switch majors to Computer Science. College was very intimiating at first with everyone saying it would be extremely diffcult. Looking back to my first day, I would tell myself to take it easy.</p>
