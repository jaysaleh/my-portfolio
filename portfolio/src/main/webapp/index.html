          <h1>Mexico Trip</h1>
          <p>
            After wrapping up freshman year, my high school friends and I reunited in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
            for about 9 days. We spent most of our time in Mexico relaxing on the beach, exploring nearby cities,
            trying different foods, and snorkeling. My favorite restaurant during this trip was the
            <b><i><a href="https://bit.ly/3fU8Dr6" target="_blank" class="link">Sonora Grill Prime.</a></i></b>
            The bean and cheese dip and the atmosphere in the restaurant were the highlight. This is one of my
            favorite trips I’ve been on and I will definitely remember the time spent with my friends.

          <h1>Toilet Bowl Cliff Jumping</h1>
          <p>
            Following my high school graduation, I went on a weekend trip with my friends to Santa Cruz, California.
            During our weekend trip, one of our friends had the brilliant idea to go cliff jumping at the 
            <i><b><a href="https://bit.ly/31jEZYq" target="_blank" class="link">Toilet Bowl.</a></b></i> 
            All three of my friends (Daniel, Elliot, Alex) jumped off the cliff, but I, being the lightest out of 
            everyone and given the dangerous wind conditions, decided to not jump. Walking back to the beach I hear
            “HELP!” My friend Alex was drowning. He almost died but some surfer bros helped him out so he turned out
            to be fine. Not the wisest decision he has ever made, but I'm glad he made it out.

          <h1>3D Printed Rocket</h1>
          <p>
            In high school, I began tinkering with 3D printing and rocketry. At the start of my junior year,
            working with a classmate and a physics teacher, we were able to set up a 3D printer lab on campus
            consisting of 15 printers for any one to use. The image on the right is taken off a GoPro our rocketry
            club had mounted inside a custom printed rocket. Using these 3D printers, I build several devices
            for my Science Olympiad events such as Robot Arm, Wind Power, Rube Goldberg, and Hovercraft.

          <h1>Robot Arm</h1>
          <p>
            This is a robot arm attachment that I designed using CAD and then 3D printed. The purpose of the robot
            was to pick up 5 stacks of pennies and lay all of them out flat on a target, opposite side facing up.
            In this design, the top part of the attachment is used to pick up the pennies. The clamp then closes,
            securing the pennies. The attachment then rotates, flipping all the pennies. The motor on the bottom
            of the attachment feeds out one penny at a time.

          <h1>SafetyNet - Hackathon Project</h1>
          <p>
            At the 2019 TreeHacks competition, my roomates and I came up with a safety application that was meant
            to reduce crime on campus. Within the application, any user can request help. Their request would be
            pinged to any user who is nearby. Those users can choose to respond to help. The goal of this project
            was to promote community safety. This was my first app development project so I learned a lot in the
            32 hours given to build it.
