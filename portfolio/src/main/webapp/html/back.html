            My mother birthed her second child (me) on August 12th, 2000 at 4:44 PM at Dameron Hospital in Stockton, California. 
            I don't rememeber the journey but apparently I almost died. Shortly after, I traveled 16 miles north to my new crib. 
            Above is a picture of me with all my new drip.

          <p>
            This was my first trip to Mickie Grove Park, a local park with a zoo. I was terrified of animals before this day, but 
            I really liked the parrots they had. From this day foward, my parents would take me to the zoo pretty often.

          <p>
            This was my family's first computer, the eMachine T3985. I loved this thing. I remember spending long nights playing
            computer games. Around this time I also started school at first grade. I missed preschool, kindgarden, and part of
            first grade as I was out of the country.

            This is where I went to Elementary School. I spent 2006 - 2011 here. As mentioned previously, I started school at 1st grade
            so the majority of my time here was spent catching up. I'll take the next few slides to introduce my town/schools.
            Shoutout to <br> Mr. McKilligan, you're a real one.

            This is my High School. I would say about 80% of my memories come from this place. I made a lot of freinds here through 
            several activities such as cross country, track and field, rocketry club, the 3D printing lab, and Science Olympiad. As 
            much as I hated this place while I was there, I miss the memories I made with my friends before we all went our own respective paths.

            I started school on Septemeber 21st 2018. Going into college I was premed. After taking
            <b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/" target="_blank" id="cs-link">CS106B</a></b> (Programing Abstractions),
            I found the content very enagaging and decided to switch majors to Computer Science. College was very intimiating at first
            with everyone saying it would be extremely diffcult. Looking back to my first day, I would tell myself to take it easy.
